##########################################

This document is a draft for "Write The Docs" poster session at EuroPython
2013 in Florence, Italy.


*****
Ideas
*****

* WriteTheDocs is about community and best practices.
* Make it become reality with a consistent toolkit (around Sphinx).
* Why WriteTheDocs? Join!
* We need (Python) developers to create or improve tools!
* Interactive Kanban-style poster (post-its + online feedback).


********
Abstract
********

(published on europython website)

Developers have places where they can find information, best practices or
generally be a member of a community. Documentation writers missed such a
location. Thatâ€™s what Write The Docs tries to bring: we hope to slowly build a
place with high quality information about the art of writing documentation.
Along with that, we hope to open communication between all the awesome people
out there writing documentation.

One goal it to help the documentarians meet. Another is to collect stories from
user experience, then promote best practices and provide tools that implement
those best practices.

This poster will present a consistent set of tools and practices around Sphinx.
Some already exist. Some are under development or planned: Python users can
help! Questions, discussions and contributions will be welcome!

Vision
******

Write the Docs is a place where the art and science of documentation can be
practiced and appreciated.

Lot of people out there write docs, but there was no good place to go to find
information, ask questions, and generally be a member of a community of
documentarians.

We hope to slowly solve this problem by building a place with high quality
information about the art of writing documentation.

Along with that, we hope to open communication between all the awesome people
out there writing documentation.

* A place
* A reference
* A community
* High quality
* Improve the experience
