Write The Docs poster
*********************

This project contains content for a poster about Write The Docs project.

Was, or will be presented at:

* https://ep2013.europython.eu/, 2013 in Florence, Italy.

Developers have places where they can find information, best practices or
generally be a member of a community. Documentation writers missed such a
location. Thatâ€™s what Write The Docs tries to bring: we hope to slowly build a
place with high quality information about the art of writing documentation.
Along with that, we hope to open communication between all the awesome people
out there writing documentation.

One goal it to help the documentarians meet. Another is to collect stories from
user experience, then promote best practices and provide tools that implement
those best practices.

This poster will present a consistent set of tools and practices around Sphinx.
Some already exist. Some are under development or planned: Python users can
help! Questions, discussions and contributions will be welcome!
